## Introduction

The Hostel Attendance Management System is a web-based application designed to automate the attendance tracking process in hostel environments. It aims to replace manual attendance-taking methods with an efficient and reliable system. My proposed solution, “FaceLog”, involves the development and implementation of an automated face recognition system tailored specifically for the hostel students. Leveraging state-of-the-art YOLO Computer Vision Technology and Deep Learning Algorithms, the system will be capable of accurately identifying students based on their facial features. By integrating with existing hostel management systems, my solution will streamline the attendance-taking process and eliminate the need for manual intervention. It will consider an attendance count for each student who enters the hostel and remove it if they exit. So, at the end of the day, the person who entered and never left, will be marked as a student currently present within the hostel, which would count for his attendance after 9PM when students are required to submit their attendance by scanning their fingerprints. The system will provide administrators with instant access to attendance data, enabling timely monitoring and analysis of student attendance patterns.
